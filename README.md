# Understanding Student Depression
My assessment of the High Rate of Mental Illness &amp; Depression in University Students.
<p><strong>Objective</strong>

This analysis investigates the contributing factors to student depression using survey data from over 28,000 students. It explores how variables such as sleep hours, academic pressure, dietary habits, financial stress, and study hours correlate with depression levels.

🧠 High-Level Insights

Depression Rate: 58.52% of students in the dataset reported experiencing depression.

Suicidal Rate: A staggering 63.27%, signaling serious mental health risks.

Top Contributing Factors:

Academic Pressure

Financial Stress

Poor Sleep

Low Study Satisfaction

🕵️ Key Findings

1. Sleep and Study Patterns

Students average 6.38 hours of sleep and 7.16 hours of study per day.

Despite decent CGPA scores (avg. 7.66), high suicidal and depression rates suggest grades are not a buffer for mental health.

2. Academic Pressure

Pressure is significantly higher among male students.

Cities like Kalyan and Hyderabad show the highest number of depressed students.

There is a direct correlation between higher academic pressure and increased depression.

3. Financial Stress

Over 12,000 students reported financial stress, strongly associated with depression.

Financially stressed students are more likely to report suicidal tendencies.

4. Diet and Lifestyle

Students with unhealthy dietary habits are more represented among those suffering from depression.

Those with a family history of mental illness show higher depression rates, particularly among females.

📌 Demographic Trends

Age Group 18–25 has the highest depression count (9.4K students), followed by the 26–35 group.

Depression rates vary by city, with Kalyan, Hyderabad, and Srinagar leading.

More females (9K) report depression compared to males (7K).

📈 Data-Driven Recommendations

Mental Health Support: Institutions should deploy targeted counseling for high-risk groups (18–25 years, financially stressed, and high academic pressure).

Academic Workload Reform: Redesign curricula to reduce burnout and introduce flexible deadlines or modular coursework.

Financial Aid Programs: Provide accessible scholarships, emergency funds, and budgeting workshops.

Health & Wellness Campaigns: Promote healthy eating, sleep hygiene, and digital detox routines.

🗣️ Final Note

This analysis not only uncovers the alarming prevalence of depression but also empowers educators and policymakers with actionable insights. The goal is simple: support students holistically, beyond grades and classes.
